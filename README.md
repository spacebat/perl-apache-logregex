Apache::LogRegex
================

*Parse a line from an Apache logfile into a hash*

This document refers to version 1.5 of Apache::LogRegex, released November 20th 2008.

Designed as a simple class to parse Apache log files. It will construct a regex that will parse the given log file format and can then parse lines from the log file line by line returning a hash of each line.

The field names of the hash are derived from the log file format. Thus if the format is '%a %t \"%r\" %s %b %T \"%{Referer}i\" ...' then the keys of the hash will be %a, %t, %r, %s, %b, %T and %{Referer}i.

Should these key names be unusable, as I guess they probably are, then subclass and provide an override rename_this_name() method that can rename the keys before they are added in the array of field names.

INSTALLATION
------------

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % sudo make install

TEST FAILURES
-------------

The tests are there to make sure that nothing breaks when the code changes but may teach you little about how to use the code. 

TO DO
-----

More efficient and flexible API while maintaining the old one

BUGS
----

There was a test failure in Perl versions > 5.13 but that should be fixed now.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Developed under 5.6.1 but should work on anything 5+.
* Written completely in Perl. XS is not required.
